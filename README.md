# PowerShell
Not to be confused with the windows thing, Very different and different purpose. Maybe I should rename is SuDoShell.
Gambas Framework to allow an application to execute Linux command and applications with raised security level with Sudo.
This is done by starting a Shell like process in background. The UI askes for the Sudo password Once when creating the
Background Process. This process will continue until the Main application kills the Process or exits.

The App provided is just a framework with a sample MAIN function.
